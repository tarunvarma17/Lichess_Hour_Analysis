# Lichess_Hour_Analysis

Famous chess website Lichess.org allows its users to access their API, which I have used here to draw analytics.

The aim of this project was to create a method by which any user can enter their Lichess.org username, and they will receive a graphic displaying at what time (hour of the day), they play their best chess. (Ranked by looking at results of games played in that hour)
